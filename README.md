## About the project
Gyroflow is an application that can stabilize your video by using motion data from gyroscope (IMU). Modern cameras record that data internally (GoPro, Sony, Insta360 etc), and this application stabilizes the captured footage precisely by using them. It can also use gyro data from an external source (eg. from Betaflight blackbox).

## Features
- Real time preview, params adjustments and all calculations
- GPU processing and rendering
- Fully multi-threaded
- Rolling shutter correction
- Supports already stabilized GoPro videos (captured with Hypersmooth enabled) (Hero 8 and up)
- Supports and renders 10-bit videos (and higher, up to 16-bit 4:4:4, direct YUV rendering with no data loss - no conversion to RGB)
- Visual chart with gyro data (can display gyro, accel, magnetometer and quaternions)
- Visual display of smoothed quaternions
- Real time offset adjustments
- Two optical flow methods
- Two offsets calculation methods
- Dark and Light theme
- Adaptive zoom (dynamic cropping)
- Based on [telemetry-parser](https://github.com/AdrianEddy/telemetry-parser) - supports all gyro sources out of the box
- Gyro low pass filter, arbitrary rotation (pitch, roll, yaw angles) and orientation
- Multiple gyro integration methods
- Cross-platform - currently works on Windows/Linux/Mac, with Android and iOS apps coming
- Multiple UI languages
- Supports variable frame rate videos, all calculations are done on timestamps
- x264, x265, ProRes and PNG outputs, with x264 and x265 fully GPU accelerated
- Automatic lens calibration process
- Fully zero-copy GPU preview rendering is possible, implemented and *almost* working (ðŸ˜€)
- Core engine is a separate library without external dependencies (no Qt, no ffmpeg, no OpenCV), and can be used to create OpenFX and Adobe plugins (on the TODO list)
- Automatic updates of lens profile database

### Info for cameras not on the list

- For cameras which do have built-in gyro, please contact us and we will implement support for that camera
- For cameras which don't have built-in gyro, please consider using Betaflight FC or check out our [flowshutter](https://github.com/gyroflow/flowshutter) project.

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/AdrianEddy/gyroflow/issues) for a list of proposed features and known issues.

### Video editor plugins 
Adobe After Effects and Davinci Resolve plugins are planned, but not ready yet

* If you want to implement a feature, you can fork this project, implement your code and open a pull request.

### Translations
Currently *Gyroflow* is available in:
* **English** (base language)
* **Polish** (by [AdrianEddy](https://github.com/AdrianEddy))
* **German** (by [Grommi](https://github.com/Gro2mi))
* **Chinese Simplified** (by [DusKing1](https://github.com/DusKing1))

Help us translate *Gyroflow* to your language! We use *crowdin* to manage translations and you can contribute there: https://crowdin.com/project/gyroflow

#### I want to contribute but I don't know Rust or QML
* The Rust book is a great way to get started with Rust: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
* Additional useful resources for Rust: https://quickref.me/rust and https://cheats.rs/
* For the UI stuff, there's a nice QML book by The Qt Company: https://www.qt.io/product/qt6/qml-book


## Development
### Used languages and technologies
*Gyroflow* is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), with UI written in [QML](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qmlfirststeps.html). It uses *Qt*, *ffmpeg*, *OpenCV* and *mdk-sdk* external dependencies for the main program, but the core library is written in pure Rust without any external dependencies.

OpenCV usage is kept to a minimum, used only for lens calibration and optical flow (`src/core/calibration/mod.rs` and `src/core/synchronization/opencv.rs`). Core algorithms and undistortion don't use OpenCV.

GPU stuff supports *DirectX*, *OpenGL*, *Metal* and *Vulkan* thanks to *Qt RHI* and *wgpu*.
For GPU processing we use *OpenCL* or *wgpu*, with highly parallelized CPU implementation as a fallback.

### Code structure
1. Entire GUI is in the `src/ui` diretory
2. `src/controller.rs` is a bridge between UI and core, it takes all commands from QML and calls functions in core
3. `src/core` contains the whole gyroflow engine and doesn't depend on *Qt* or *ffmpeg*, and *OpenCV* is optional
4. `src/rendering` contains all FFmpeg related code for rendering final video and processing for synchronization
5. `src/core/gpu` contains GPU implementations of the undistortion
6. `src/qt_gpu` contains zero-copy GPU undistortion path, using Qt RHI and GLSL compute shader, but this method is experimental and buggy for now
7. `src/gyroflow.rs` is the main entry point and contains a TODO list of things that still need to be done. Also there's a ton of TODO comments throughout the code
8. `mod.rs` or `lib.rs` in each directory act as a main entry of the module (directory name is the module name and `mod.rs` is kind of an entry point)

### Dev environment
`Visual Studio Code` with `rust-analyzer` extension.

For working with QML I recommend to use Qt Creator and load all QML files there, as it has auto-complete and syntax highlighting.
The project also supports UI live reload, it's a super quick way of working with the UI. Just change `live_reload = true` in `gyroflow.rs` and it should work right away. Now every time you change any QML file, the app should reload it immediately.
